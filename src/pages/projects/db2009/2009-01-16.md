#### Review

##### Set 1

###### Uber Glue >

Nothing crazy, but nice intro to the song. Good way to kick off the show. Nice sample/glitch work from Magner. Very clean guitar from Barber.

###### Spacebirdmatingcall >

Big On Time teases - Fun note; On Time was debuted ~9 months later (2009-10-10) at the same venue (Calvin Theater).

###### Air Song**<sup>i</sup>** >

Some really fun, interesting stuff going on here.

###### Spacebirdmatingcall

Nice ending.

###### Tamarin Alley

Dig it; a song with a thugish feel. Solid version. Hot all around.

##### Set 2

###### Banter

Actually some cool backing music (from Aron?).

###### M80

Gets into a good place around 5:30.

###### Little Shimmy in a Conga Line**<sup>d</sup>***

Fun vocals in the tongue-rolling part (Barber _almost_ loses it after that), fun guitar work > breakdown around 11:00.

###### Spraypaint *

Such a nice intro about 3:45 in; some firey work from Barber @ ~5:45.

###### Triumph >

Gets pretty light and fun towards the end; what are they teasing @ ~ 7:50. 9:30 almost gets into some "Home Again" areas.

###### Basis For a Day >

Nothing crazy, but good; really nice breakdown ~ 9:40.

###### And the Ladies Were the Rest of the Night >

Intro (~3:30) is really nice, though it _almost_ gets a little screechy.

###### Basis For a Day

Great wrap up/outro.

##### Encore

###### Munchkin

Nothing notable; Brownie really tries to lower expectations before they start â˜º
