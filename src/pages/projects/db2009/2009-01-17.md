#### Review

##### Set 1

###### Rivers

Always love Rivers. Some fun grooves ~ half way through. It looks like at the time this song was called "New Autumn Hop"?

###### House Dog Party Favor >

Fine enough. Barber almost looses it around 7 minutes but manages to pull it off. Nice segue into Crystal Ball...

###### Crystal Ball**<sup>i</sup>** >

###### House Dog Party Favor**<sup>u</sup>** >

###### ATW**<sup>e</sup>**

Great soothing way to close the set. Mark starts getting it with the bass round 4 min in.

##### Set 2

###### Killing in the Name >

Messy but fun/good. Really cool outro jam

###### Crickets**<sup>i</sup>** >

Super interesting first jam, love the second time the flute comes in, 15:00 jam is dope

###### King of the World**<sup>\*</sup>** >

OMG is this inverted? Gets dirty/industrial. Total tease; almost build to "I'm the King of the World!", but no lyrics are sang. Not listed in Archive.org setlist.

###### Gangster >

Almost gets into some Spacebird territory around 3:00; sounds a bit wonky around 3:30

###### Iman

Just great

##### Encore

###### Mr Don

A lot of fun; enjoyed it more than I usually like a Mr Don
